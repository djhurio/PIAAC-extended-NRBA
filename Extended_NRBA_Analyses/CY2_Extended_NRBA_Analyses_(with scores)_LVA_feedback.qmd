## Introduction

This is a feedback on the "[Extended NRBA Analyses (with scores) LVA](https://piaac.ets.org/portal/extended-nrba-analyses-with-scores-lva/)" conducted by the Consortium.

## ANALYSIS 1: Estimates Before and After Weighting

### Comments by the Consorcium

Notes: 

- A t-test is used for this analysis. PROBF1 is the resulting p-value from the t-test.
- Significant differences are those with PROBF1 < Bonferroni Alpha. Bonferroni Alpha is calculated as `alpha(0.05)/(number of categories)`.
- "Eligible SPs" are all sample persons, excluding ineligible cases (those with `DISP_CIBQ=18 or 25`).
- "Respondents" are sampled persons with `WEIGHTFLG=1` (that is, with `DISP_CIBQ=1 or (DISP_CIBQ=7 and DISP_DS=1)`).
- Cases with missing values for an analysis variable were excluded from the analysis for that variable.

Significant differences between the base-weighted estimates and all eligible SPs existed for all variables in the analysis except Number of declared residents aged 16-65 and Indicator if a child (aged 0-14) is in a household.

In general, the differences in the estimates are smaller after the nonresponse adjustment, indicating that the BQ nonresponse adjustment was effective in reducing the nonresponse bias in these estimates. Significant differences remain in Household size from Screener, Share of one person households by JURISDICTION and cities, and Unemployment level in age group 15-64 by JURISDICTION and cities. Significant differences in very small categories (<1% of total) of Share of population aged 15 and over with upper secondary education or higher (ISCED 3-8) by cities, towns, rural territories and neighbourhoods, Share of owner occupied dwellings by JURISDICTION-2021 and neighbourhoods, Share of occupied dwellings by JURISDICTION-2021 and neighbourhoods, and Share of citizens of Latvia by cities, towns, rural territories and neighbourhoods should be interpreted with caution. Working status, age, education, and region were used in calibration, which would have addressed the remaining bias in these variables.

### Comments by LVA

I was able to reproduce most of the results. I got some differences in p-values (columns "PROBF1 (1) v (2)" and "PROBF2 (1) v (3)"):

```

6:                 Bonferroni Alpha                                 TRUE
```

The column `value.orig` refers to the values calculated by the consorcium and the column `value.test` refers to my calculations.

```

10:   PERSVAR2    28 PROBF2 (1) v (3)          1     0.3205
```

Another example:

10:       AREAVAR2    28 PROBF2 (1) v (3)     0.3268     0.3269
```

The differences in the p-values does not influence your conclusions. I agree with them.

## ANALYSIS 2: Comparison to External Estimates

### Comments by the Consorcium

Notes: 

- TESTPCT is the external source estimate. Variances for percentages were derived through linearization of the variance of a ratio using standard errors of the totals provided by the country.
- The PIAAC final weights were used in this analysis. 
- The Rao-Scott Chi-square test, along with a t-test, are used for this analysis. Significant differences are those with p-value < 0.05.
- Cases with missing values for an analysis variable were excluded from the analysis for that variable.

According to the chi-square test, labor status, labor status * gender, labor status * age groups, and labor status * gender * age groups show statistically significant differences in their overall distribution between the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and PIAAC distributions. 

When looking further at the t-test results for individual categories, one can see that significant differences between the PIAAC and LFS estimates are found in less than a half of the categories, which is true for every variable. 

The percent unemployed (both overall and per gender) is significantly higher in PIAAC, but significantly lower for employed males, young (16-25) inactive population,  and employed 46-65 y.o. individuals. However, all of these significant differences are limited to 1-2 percent. LVA’s description explains why differences are expected: 

- The LFS estimates refer to the 1st quarter of 2023. PIAAC fieldwork period covers wider period.
- Data collection methods for the LFS are CAPI, CATI, and CAWI.
- The LFS covers population aged 15-89. However, the selected estimates for the NRBA cover the population aged 15-64. Please note there is a one year shift in comparison to the PIAAC target population (aged 16-65). There is a one year shift for all age groups. For example, age group 16-65 in PIAAC is compared with age group 15-64 in LFS, and PIAAC age group 16-25 is compared with age group 15-24 in LFS.
- Question wording differs, because labour status in the LFS is measured with many specific questions. Labour status is one of the main LFS measures. So, it is measured very precisely. On contrary labour status for the PIAAC is only a proxy variable and it is measured with only one question (C2_Q07). Obviously the labour status measures will differ in LFS and PIAAC because of this.


### Comments by LVA

I am not able to reproduce exactly your results. However I agree with your comments.

## ANALYSIS 3: Explained Variation in Outcomes (EVO)

### Comments by the Consorcium

Although Latvia’s combined weighted response rate was 33.1%, the weighting adjustments (nonresponse adjustment and raking) have reduced the potential for bias so that the responding sample explains more than 33.1% of the information that would have been obtained if the entire selected sample responded to the survey. The explained variation in literacy is 47.2% (with standard error (SE)=1.36%). The explained variation in numeracy is 43.6% (SE=1.26%). The explained variation in adaptive problem solving is 47.6% (SE=1.38%). The degree to which EVO is greater than the combined weighted response rate reflects the relative effectiveness of the weighting adjustments in reducing the potential for bias.

### Comments by LVA

I am getting slightly different EVO scores. However, I agree with your comments.



## ANALYSIS 4: Comparison of estimates from alternative weighting adjustments

### Comments by the Consorcium

Notes: 

- A t-test is used for this analysis. PROBF is the resulting p-value from the t-test.
- Significant differences are those with PROBF < Bonferroni Alpha. Bonferroni Alpha is calculated as `alpha(0.05)/(number of categories)`.
- 'Notable' differences are significant differences for which the absolute value of ESTDIFF (i.e., MEAN1-MEAN2) is greater than the standard error of MEAN1 (STDERR1). Only 'notable' differences are mentioned here.

For Latvia, final weights were recalibrated to population totals for gender by highest education level which came from the official education statistics. The original calibration used gender by age groups and two other unrelated raking dimensions. Also, the alternative control totals came from a different source. 
Some differences between the mean proficiency scores calculated using final weights and the re-weighted mean proficiency scores were significant, with absolute differences ranging from 1.44 to 4.63. Notable significant differences were observed in for the following variables:

- overall and by gender for all three proficiency scores;
- CI_AGE_CAT (age categories): for ages 36-45 and 51-55 for PVLIT1, for ages 31-45 and 51-55 for PVNUM1, and ages 36-45 for PVAPS1; 
- NRBAVAR8 (labor force status): for category 1 (employed) for all three proficiency scores;
- NRBAVAR13 (region): for all regions and all three proficiency scores except for regions 4 (Kurzeme) and 6 (Latgale) for PVLIT1, region 6 for PVNUM1, and regions 1 (Riga), 3 (Vidzeme), 4, and 6 for PVAPS1.

### Comments by LVA

I agree with your comments.


## ANALYSIS 5: BQ LRNR compared to other BQ NR

### Comments by the Consorcium

Notes: 

- BQ LRNR cases are those with `DISP_CIBQ=7, 8 or 9`.
- Other BQ NR cases are those with `DISP_CIBQ not in (1, 7, 8, 9, 18, 25)`.
- Person base weights were used in this analysis. 
- The Rao-Scott Chi-square test is used for this analysis. Significant differences are those with p-value < 0.05.
- Most variables (NRBAVAR1-NRBAVAR7, Age group, DUVAR_SCRRESP1, PERSVAR2-PERSVAR5) were excluded from this analysis due to empty cells.
- Cases with missing values for an analysis variable were excluded from the analysis for that variable.

Compared to other nonrespondents at the BQ stage, the literacy-related nonrespondents (`DISP_CIBQ = 7, 8, or 9`) are similar to other BQ nonrespondents based on age group, gender, highest education level, Indicator if a child (aged 0-14) is in a household, urban/rural, and cities/towns/rural.


### Comments by LVA

I do not agree with your conclusion here. We can conclude there is not enough evidence (test power) to reject null hypothesis (H0). That does not imply H0 is true. The main reason for this is the fact there are **only 24 LRNR cases**. I do not agree we can conclude the LRNR cases are similar with other nonrespondents using the provided information.

The following plot shows that it is hard to conclude anything about similarities of the two groups.

## ANALYSIS 5: SCR LRNR compared to other SCR NR

### Comments by the Consorcium

Notes: 

- Screener LRNR cases are those with `DISP_SCR=7`.
- Other Screener NR cases are those with `DISP_SCR not in (1, 2, 7, 19, 22, 26, 27, 28)`.
- Household unknown eligibility weights were used in this analysis. 
- The Rao-Scott Chi-square test is used for this analysis. Significant differences are those with p-value < 0.05.
- Most variables were excluded from this analysis due to empty cells.
- Cases with missing values for an analysis variable were excluded from the analysis for that variable.

Compared to other nonrespondents at the screener stage, the literacy-related nonrespondents (`DISP_SCR = 7`) are similar to other screener nonrespondents based on urban/rural and the percentages in cities, towns, suburbs and rural area. 

Given that there are no unexpected patterns, the analysis does not raise concerns about the assignment of literacy-related disposition codes or the treatment of LRNR cases in weighting.


### Comments by LVA

Similar comment as before. I do not agree with your conclusion here. Not rejecting null hypothesis (H0) does not imply H0 is true. The main reason for this is the fact there are **only 18 LRNR cases**. I do not agree we can conclude the LRNR cases are similar with other non-respondents using the provided information.

The following plot shows that it is hard to conclude anything about similarities of the two groups.

## ANALYSIS 6: Level-of-effort analysis

### Comments by the Consorcium

This analysis shows the cumulative mean proficiency scores by the number of contact attempts. The cumulative mean scores by number of contacts for literacy, numeracy, and adaptive problem solving show a steady increase with the number of contacts in the first few visits, indicating that respondents who are harder to contact score higher on average than lower level-of-effort respondents. Beyond the first few visits, there was very little change in the mean scores. The harder to reach cases score differently than the completes with fewer contacts, therefore we assume that field efforts were reaching cases with different characteristics, cases similar to nonrespondents, and as a result were effective in reducing potential bias.

### Comments by LVA

I agree with your conclusions. Please add entry with 15 contact attempts (`CONTACTTOTAL=14`) in the table and plot.



## ANALYSIS 7: Calculation of the range of potential bias

### Comments by the Consorcium

This analysis looks at how the mean proficiency score would vary based on different assumptions for nonrespondents. The potential range of bias is calculated as the difference between the upper and lower estimates of the mean. In particular, the analysis calculates the mean proficiency score for the full sample (based on the 1st plausible value) assuming nonrespondents took the 40th percentile of the mean score for respondents within each nonresponse adjustment cell (this gives the lower estimate), and compares it to the result using the 60th percentile (the upper estimate). Using this approach, the predicted range of the mean score (i.e., range of bias) was computed to be 17 for literacy, 17 for numeracy, and 15 for adaptive problem solving. These results indicate that data users need to be cautioned about the potential for nonresponse bias in the country’s data. However, it should be noted that the analysis is based on assumptions about the range of proficiency scores for sampled cases that have no scores (69.8% of the sample).


### Comments by LVA

I confirm your calculations.
